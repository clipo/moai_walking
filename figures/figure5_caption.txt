Figure 5. Relationship between moai base angle and size metric (total length × base width) for intact road moai (n = 13). Despite a 20-fold variation in size, base angles remain remarkably consistent between 5° and 14°. Point size indicates moai height, and colors distinguish final positions (prone = successful transport, supine = fell backward). The negligible correlation (r = -0.044) suggests standardized construction techniques optimized for walking transport regardless of moai size.
